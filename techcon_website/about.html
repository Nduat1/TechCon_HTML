            <h2>History of TechCon</h2>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <p>
                TechCon started in 2005 as a small gathering of tech enthusiasts eager 
                to explore the latest innovations in software and hardware development. 
                Over the years, it has evolved into a global event, bringing together 
                thousands of developers, entrepreneurs, and thought leaders to discuss 
                cutting-edge technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                The early years of TechCon focused primarily on open-source software and 
                community-driven development. However, as technology advanced, the 
                conference expanded its scope to include AI, machine learning, blockchain, 
                and sustainable tech innovations. Today, TechCon is known for being a hub 
                of inspiration and collaboration in the tech industry.
